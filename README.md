# CodeHelp-Supreme2.0-Journey
 This GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive record of my coding journey during the Supreme 2.0 batch with CodeHelp. It will document my progress, code projects, and learning experiences as I strive to become a proficient programmer.
# Purpose:
Learning Diary: 
      This repository will function as a digital diary of my coding journey, allowing me to reflect on my progress, challenges, and achievements throughout the course.
      
Project Showcase:
        I will showcase the coding projects, exercises, and assignments I complete during the Supreme 2.0 batch. This will not only help me keep track of my work but also serve as a portfolio for potential collaborators.
        
Community Engagement:
        I encourage fellow learners, mentors, and the CodeHelp community to provide feedback, suggestions, and collaborate on projects. Together, we can learn and grow as developers.
